 * 227A_Centreline.vtk -- Clinically-sourced centreline (LAD, RCA, diagonals)
   with three bifurcations.
 * 721A_Centreline.vtk -- Clinically-sourced centreline (LAD, diagonal) with one
   bifurcation.
 * SyntheticBifurcation_1.vtk -- Synthetic single bifurcation centreline in XY
   plane with a 45 degree bifurcation angle.
 * SyntheticBifurcation_2.vtk -- Same as above, but the centreline is wrapped on
   a sphere surface.
 * SyntheticBifurcation_3.vtk -- Synthetic single bifurcation centreline in XY
   plane with a 30 degree bifurcation angle.
 * SyntheticBifurcation_4.vtk -- Same as above, but the centreline is wrapped on
   a sphere surface.
