LINPACK is a collection of Fortran subroutines that analyze and
solve linear equations and linear least-squares probles.  The
package solves linear systems whose matrices are general, banded,
symmetric indefinite, symmetric positive definite, triangular,
and tridiagonal square.  In addition, the package computes
the QR and singular value decompositions of rectangular matrices
and applies them to least-squares problems.  LINPACK uses
column-oriented algorithms to increase efficiency by preserving
locality of reference.

LINPACK was designed for supercomputers in use in the 1970s and
early 1980s.  LINPACK has been largely superceded by LAPACK
which has been designed to run efficiently on shared-memory, vector
supercomputers.

Developed by Jack Dongarra, Jim Bunch, Cleve Moler and Pete Stewart.

 If you are interested in acquiring the entire LINPACK, it may
 make more sense to talk with NAG. NAG distribute the software
 on a mag tape for a nominal charge.
