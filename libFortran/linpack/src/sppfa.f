      subroutine sppfa(ap,n,info)
      integer n,info
      real ap(*)
c
c     sppfa factors a real symmetric positive definite matrix
c     stored in packed form.
c
c     sppfa is usually called by sppco, but it can be called
c     directly with a saving in time if  rcond  is not needed.
c     (time for sppco) = (1 + 18/n)*(time for sppfa) .

c     on entry
c
c        ap      real (n*(n+1)/2)
c                the packed form of a symmetric matrix  a .  the
c                columns of the upper triangle are stored sequentially
c                in a one-dimensional array of length  n*(n+1)/2 .
c                see comments below for details.
c
c        n       integer
c                the order of the matrix  a .
c
c     on return
c
c        ap      an upper triangular matrix  r , stored in packed
c                form, so that  a = trans(r)*r .
