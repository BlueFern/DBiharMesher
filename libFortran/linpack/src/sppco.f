c        ap      real (n*(n+1)/2)
c                the packed form of a symmetric matrix  a .  the

c                in a one-dimensional array of length  n*(n+1)/2 .
c                see comments below for details.

c
c     on return
c
c        ap      an upper triangular matrix  r , stored in packed
c                form, so that  a = trans(r)*r .
c                if  info .ne. 0 , the factorization is not complete.
c
c        rcond   real
c                an estimate of the reciprocal condition of  a .
c                for the system  a*x = b , relative perturbations
c                in  a  and  b  of size  epsilon  may cause

c        z       real(n)
c                a work vector whose contents are usually unimportant.
c                if  a  is singular to working precision, then  z  is
c                an approximate null vector in the sense that
c                norm(a*z) = rcond*norm(a)*norm(z) .

c
c        info    integer
c                = 0  for normal return.
c                = k  signals an error condition.  the leading minor
