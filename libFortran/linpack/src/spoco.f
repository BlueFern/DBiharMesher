      subroutine spoco(a,lda,n,rcond,z,info)

c
c     spoco factors a real symmetric positive definite matrix
c     and estimates the condition of the matrix.
c
c     if  rcond  is not needed, spofa is slightly faster.

c
c        a       real(lda, n)
c                the symmetric matrix to be factored.  only the
c                diagonal and upper triangle are used.
c
c        lda     integer
c                the leading dimension of the array  a .
c
c        n       integer
c                the order of the matrix  a .
c
c     on return
c
c        a       an upper triangular matrix  r  so that  a = trans(r)*r
c                where  trans(r)  is the transpose.
c                the strict lower triangle is unaltered.
c                if  info .ne. 0 , the factorization is not complete.
c
c        rcond   real
c                an estimate of the reciprocal condition of  a .
c                for the system  a*x = b , relative perturbations
c                in  a  and  b  of size  epsilon  may cause
c                relative perturbations in  x  of size  epsilon/rcond .
c                if  rcond  is so small that the logical expression
c                           1.0 + rcond .eq. 1.0
c                is true, then  a  may be singular to working
c                precision.  in particular,  rcond  is zero  if
c                exact singularity is detected or the estimate
c                underflows.  if info .ne. 0 , rcond is unchanged.
c
c        z       real(n)
c                a work vector whose contents are usually unimportant.
c                if  a  is close to a singular matrix, then  z  is
c                an approximate null vector in the sense that
c                norm(a*z) = rcond*norm(a)*norm(z) .
c                if  info .ne. 0 , z  is unchanged.
c
c        info    integer
c                = 0  for normal return.
c                = k  signals an error condition.  the leading minor
c                     of order  k  is not positive definite.
