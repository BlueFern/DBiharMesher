c     ctrco estimates the condition of a complex triangular matrix.

c
c        t       complex(ldt,n)
c                t contains the triangular matrix. the zero
c                elements of the matrix are not referenced, and
c                the corresponding elements of the array can be
c                used to store other information.
c
c        ldt     integer
c                ldt is the leading dimension of the array t.
c
c        n       integer
c                n is the order of the system.
c
c        job     integer
c                = 0         t  is lower triangular.
c                = nonzero   t  is upper triangular.
c
c     on return
c
c        rcond   real
c                an estimate of the reciprocal condition of  t .
c                for the system  t*x = b , relative perturbations
c                in  t  and  b  of size  epsilon  may cause
c                relative perturbations in  x  of size  epsilon/rcond .
c                if  rcond  is so small that the logical expression
c                           1.0 + rcond .eq. 1.0
c                is true, then  t  may be singular to working
c                precision.  in particular,  rcond  is zero  if
c                exact singularity is detected or the estimate
c                underflows.
c
c        z       complex(n)
c                a work vector whose contents are usually unimportant.
c                if  t  is close to a singular matrix, then  z  is
c                an approximate null vector in the sense that
c                norm(a*z) = rcond*norm(a)*norm(z) .
