      subroutine cpodi(a,lda,n,det,job)
      integer lda,n,job

      real det(2)
c
c     cpodi computes the determinant and inverse of a certain
c     complex hermitian positive definite matrix (see below)
c     using the factors computed by cpoco, cpofa or cqrdc.
c
c     on entry
c
c        a       complex(lda, n)
c                the output  a  from cpoco or cpofa
c                or the output  x  from cqrdc.
c
c        lda     integer
c                the leading dimension of the array  a .
c
c        n       integer
c                the order of the matrix  a .

c                = 11   both determinant and inverse.
c                = 01   inverse only.

c
c        a       if cpoco or cpofa was used to factor  a  then
c                cpodi produces the upper half of inverse(a) .
c                if cqrdc was used to decompose  x  then
c                cpodi produces the upper half of inverse(ctrans(x)*x)
c                where ctrans(x) is the conjugate transpose.
c                elements of  a  below the diagonal are unchanged.
c                if the units digit of job is zero,  a  is unchanged.

c        det     real(2)
c                determinant of  a  or of  ctrans(x)*x  if requested.
c                otherwise not referenced.
c                determinant = det(1) * 10.0**det(2)

c                or  det(1) .eq. 0.0 .
c
c     error condition
c
c        a division by zero will occur if the input factor contains
c        a zero on the diagonal and the inverse is requested.
c        it will not occur if the subroutines are called correctly
c        and if cpoco or cpofa has set info .eq. 0 .
