c
c     chico factors a complex hermitian matrix by elimination with

c
c        a       complex(lda, n)
c                the hermitian matrix to be factored.
c                only the diagonal and upper triangle are used.
c
c        lda     integer
c                the leading dimension of the array  a .
c
c        n       integer

c
c     output
c
c        a       a block diagonal matrix and the multipliers which
c                were used to obtain it.
c                the factorization can be written  a = u*d*ctrans(u)
c                where  u  is a product of permutation and unit
c                upper triangular matrices , ctrans(u) is the
c                conjugate transpose of  u , and  d  is block diagonal
c                with 1 by 1 and 2 by 2 blocks.
c
c        kpvt    integer(n)
c                an integer vector of pivot indices.
c
c        rcond   real
c                an estimate of the reciprocal condition of  a .
c                for the system  a*x = b , relative perturbations
c                in  a  and  b  of size  epsilon  may cause
c                relative perturbations in  x  of size  epsilon/rcond .
c                if  rcond  is so small that the logical expression
c                           1.0 + rcond .eq. 1.0
c                is true, then  a  may be singular to working
c                precision.  in particular,  rcond  is zero  if
c                exact singularity is detected or the estimate
c                underflows.
c
c        z       complex(n)
c                a work vector whose contents are usually unimportant.
c                if  a  is close to a singular matrix, then  z  is
c                an approximate null vector in the sense that
c                norm(a*z) = rcond*norm(a)*norm(z) .
