c
c     cchud updates an augmented cholesky decomposition of the
c     triangular part of an augmented qr decomposition.  specifically,
c     given an upper triangular matrix r of order p, a row vector
c     x, a column vector z, and a scalar y, cchud determines a
c     untiary matrix u and a scalar zeta such that
c
c
c                              (r  z)     (rr   zz )
c                         u  * (    )  =  (        ) ,
c                              (x  y)     ( 0  zeta)
c
c     where rr is upper triangular.  if r and z have been
c     obtained from the factorization of a least squares
c     problem, then rr and zz are the factors corresponding to
c     the problem with the observation (x,y) appended.  in this
c     case, if rho is the norm of the residual vector, then the
c     norm of the residual vector of the updated problem is
c     sqrt(rho**2 + zeta**2).  cchud will simultaneously update
c     several triplets (z,y,rho).
c     for a less terse description of what cchud does and how
c     it may be applied see the linpack guide.
c
c     the matrix u is determined as the product u(p)*...*u(1),
c     where u(i) is a rotation in the (i,p+1) plane of the
c     form
