c
c     csidi computes the determinant and inverse

c
c     on entry
c
c        a       complex(lda,n)
c                the output from csifa.
c
c        lda     integer
c                the leading dimension of the array a.
c
c        n       integer
c                the order of the matrix a.
c
c        kpvt    integer(n)
c                the pivot vector from csifa.
c
c        work    complex(n)
c                work vector.  contents destroyed.
c
c        job     integer
c                job has the decimal expansion  ab  where
c                   if  b .ne. 0, the inverse is computed,
c                   if  a .ne. 0, the determinant is computed,
c
c                for example, job = 11  gives both.

c
c        variables not requested by job are not used.
c
c        a      contains the upper triangle of the inverse of
c               the original matrix.  the strict lower triangle
c               is never referenced.

c               or det(1) = 0.0.
c
c     error condition
c
c        a division by zero may occur if the inverse is requested
c        and  csico  has set rcond .eq. 0.0
c        or  csifa  has set  info .ne. 0 .
