c
c     m               the number of interior grid points
c                     in the x-direction. the interval

c                     m must be odd and at least 3.

c                     if m+1 is a product of small primes.

c
c     tol             the conjugate gradient iteration is
c                     terminated using this parameter.
c                     the error in the solution of the discrete
c                     approximation (not to be confused with the
c                     truncation error) can be expected to be of the
c                     same order of magnitude provided that the
c                     function f has norm of magnitude unity.
c                     a good choice for tol is taking it a few
c                     orders of magnitude less than the expected
c                     truncation error.
c                     if the right hand side f in the given problem
c                     is many orders of magnitude smaller or bigger
c                     than one, then it is recommended that the user
c                     scales his problem.
c                     tol is a dummy variable if iflag is 3 or 4.
c
c     iflag
c              =1     this option is not available in version 2.0 .
c
c              =2     if this is the first solution on this grid
c                     using conjugate gradients with fourier trans-
c                     forms in both coordinate directions.
c                     there are no parameter restrictions, but
c                     the routine is only guaranteed to work when
c                     the discrete approximation is positive
c                     definite. this is always the case when alpha
c                     is nonpositive and beta is nonnegative.
c                     in other cases the user should monitor the
c                     output parameter itcg. if it stays larger
c                     than 15, the alternative iflag=4 is
c                     recommended.
c                     a call with iflag=2 restarts the low rank
c                     approximations used to speed up convergence.
c
c              =3     if this is the first solution on this grid
c                     using cholesky factorization.
c                     the parameters must satisfy alpha.le.0 ,
c                     beta.ge.0. (if this is violated the code
c                     will change iflag to 4.)
c
c              =4     if this is the first solution on this grid
c                     using an indefinite symmetric factorization.
c                     there are no parameter restrictions, but
c                     an error return will occur if the discrete
c                     system is computationally singular.
c
c     description of output variables.
c
c     f               contains the solution u of the discrete
c                     system in all gridpoints (x ,y ),i=1,..m+2 ,
c                                                i  j  j=1,..n+2 .
c
c     iflag
c
c     normal returns.  iflag will return with a value appropriate
c                      for repeated calls. it need normally not
c                      be changed by the user between calls to
c                      sbihar.
c                      however, if a sequence of problems is being
c                      solved where the parameters alpha or beta
c                      changes then itcg should be monitored and
c                      iflag should be reset to 2 when itcg
c                      increases (say above 15).
c                      also a change between the direct and
c                      iterative version must be set explicitly.
c
c                      if the code changes the value of iflag due
c                      to a change in the user input, a warning is
c                      printed indicating the reason for the change.
c
c                      iflag=2 new initial solution (see above).
c                      iflag=3 new initial solution (see above).
c                      iflag=4 new initial solution (see above).
c                      iflag=6 repeated solution after iflag=2.
c                      iflag=7 repeated solution after iflag=3.
c                      iflag=8 repeated solution after iflag=4.
c
c     error returns.   if iflag returns a negative value then
c                      an error was detected. the computed f(i,j)
c                      should be considered wrong. an error message
c                      giving the value of iflag is printed.
c
c              =-1     n and/or m was even or less than 3.
c              =-2     a.ge.b and/or c.ge.d .
c              =-3     idf.lt.m+2 or lw is too small.
c              =-4     linpack failure in cholesky-factorization.
c                      this should not occur,check input carefully.
c              =-5     linpack detected a computationally singular
c                      system using the symmetric indefinite
c                      factorization.
c              =-6     the conjugate gradient iteration failed to
c                      converge in 30 iterations. the probable
c                      cause is an indefinite or near singular
c                      system. try using iflag=4. note that tol
c                      returns an estimate of the residual in
c                      the current conjugate gradient iteration.
c
c     tol              an upper bound on the residuals obtained in
c                      the conjugate gradient iterations.
c                      tol will therefore normally be unchanged.
c
c     itcg             the number of conjugate gradient iterations.
c                      if this is large (say 20) then a direct
c                      solution using iflag =4 may be considered.
c
c     description of workspace.
c
c     lw              integer indicating the number of elements
c                     supplied in the workspace w.
c                     lw depends on iflag in the following way:
c                     (this can be improved slightly,version 3.0 ??)
c
c          iflag=  2: lw must be at least max(7*n,3*m)+2*(n+m)+19.
c                     if only one problem is solved on the grid then
c                     lw should be given its minimum value. (for
c                     maximum speed.)
c                     if several problems are to be solved then
c                     any larger lw will reduce the execution
c                     time for subsequent problems.(a low rank
c                     correction will be computed and used to
c                     improve the preconditioning that is used.)
c                     the code will not make use of lw larger than
c                     max(7*n,3*m)+2*(n+m)+19+20*(n+3) under any
c                     circumstance.
c
c         iflag=3,4:  lw must be at least max(3*m,4*n)+4*n+2*m
