These routines were obtained from Petter Bjorstad, Veritas Research,
Box 300 N-1322 Norway, in July 1984.  They call FFT routines from
Swarztrauber, modified to use unique single and double precision names.
For an index and user manual for the fft routines,
send only fft.doc from bihar.

   I thought I corrected a couple of routine in netlib/bihar before.
In any case, I just changed [sd]bipl.f to remove a bug in the indefinite
case.  I also modified [sd]biplr.f to make the storage requirements
checked in the code correspond to the documentation in the comments.
